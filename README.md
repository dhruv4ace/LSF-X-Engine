# üìò LSF-X Engine  
**A Speed-Based, Least-Squares-Driven, Kalman-Enhanced Momentum EA for MetaTrader 5**

---

## üîß Strategy Overview

**LSF-X Engine** is a high-performance Expert Advisor for MetaTrader 5 that trades based on **momentum bursts**, **least-squares trend fitting**, and **Kalman-filtered signal smoothing**.

It integrates:

- üìà **Rate Speed Analysis** ‚Äì Captures rapid price accelerations
- üìâ **Least Squares Fitting (LSF)** ‚Äì Derives trend direction with minimal noise
- üîÆ **Kalman Filter** ‚Äì Smooths signals and filters false entries
- ‚è± **Multi-Timeframe Trend Confirmation** ‚Äì Aligns signals across timeframes
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Robust Trade Management** ‚Äì SL, TP, Trailing Stop, and signal dashboard

Designed for fast-moving markets and clean directional setups.

## üìê Math Behind the Strategy

### 1. Rate of Change Speed

Measures price change intensity over a fixed lookback window `n`:

Speed_t = |Price_t - Price_{t-n}| / n

- Detects impulsive price moves
- Filters out sideways/ranging behavior

---

### 2. Least Squares Fitting (LSF) Slope

Fits a line to recent prices using least squares regression to find slope `m`:

#### Slope Formula:

m = (W * Œ£(i * P_i) - Œ£i * Œ£P_i) / (W * Œ£(i¬≤) - (Œ£i)¬≤)

Where:
- `W` is the window length
- `i` is the index (1, 2, ..., W)
- `P_i` is the price at index `i`

A positive slope indicates uptrend, negative slope indicates downtrend.

### 3. Kalman Filter

A recursive estimator that smooths price series by balancing model trust and market noise.

#### Prediction:

xÃÇ_k^- = xÃÇ_{k-1} P_k^- = P_{k-1} + Q

#### Update:

K_k = P_k^- / (P_k^- + R) xÃÇ_k = xÃÇ_k^- + K_k * (z_k - xÃÇ_k^-) P_k = (1 - K_k) * P_k^-


Where:
- `xÃÇ_k` = Estimated state (filtered price)
- `z_k` = Observed price
- `K_k` = Kalman gain
- `Q` = Process noise (model trust)
- `R` = Measurement noise (price trust)

This improves entry quality and reduces whipsaws.

---

### 4. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation

Before placing a trade, the EA verifies that a **higher timeframe** agrees with the current signal:

- Uses LSF + Kalman filter on MTF
- Confirms higher trend direction
- Prevents trading against large trend structure

---

## üìä Strategy Logic

### ‚úÖ Entry Criteria (Buy Example):

- `Speed` > `SpeedThreshold`
- `LSF Slope` > 0
- `Kalman Filter` is sloping up
- `MTF Trend` confirms long bias

### ‚ùå Exit Criteria:

- Stop Loss hit
- Take Profit hit
- Trailing Stop triggered
- Optional exit on signal flip (slope or Kalman reversal)
